ase1:- deltacycle info of nonblocking assignment statement.
   In vcs to enable delta cycle info compile the design with -debug_pp
   To view delta cycle difference in DVE go to delta cycle -> expand time option
   Below is the code that captured the delta cycle delay between Blocking and NBA assignment

  In synchronous rst design, rst must be active before 1st edge of the clock. So assign rst using blocking and initialize clk using NBA.
  In asynchronous rst design,order of rst and clk doesn't matter. But both clk and rst should be assigned using NBA

module nonblocking();

 timeunit 1us;
 timeprecision 1ns;
 bit clk;
 reg rst;

 initial begin
  clk = 1'b0;
 #5ns clk = 1'b1;

 end

 initial begin
  rst <= 1'b1;
  #5ns rst <= 1'b0;
 end

 initial begin
 $dumpfile("file.vcd");
 $dumpvars(0);
 $vcdpluson(0);
$vcdplusdeltacycleon;
#30;
 $vcdplusdeltacycleoff;
 end

initial begin
 $timeformat(-9,3,"ns",5);
$display("starting tb");
#30;
$display("ending tb %t",$time);
$finish();
end

endmodule:nonblocking

Case 2 : Write a code on trigger persistance feature.

  wait(tmp_event.triggered) statement uses trigger persistance feature which will be active through out the simulation timestep not just at the instant when tmp_event is triggered.

Write a not on 4 state inequality operater
