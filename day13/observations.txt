1) Worked on delayed version of a signal,
revised inertial and transport delays

Note:- Assign statement can schedule only one active assignment at a time

Inertial delays as below can be used to model setup time of any physical cells, i.e if input changes faster than intertial delay,previous values are lost.

Ex:- assign #1400ns w_clk_d = clk;

Note:- Filtering can be reduced by chaining smaller delays; the same strategy is used with physical delay cells.

wire   #700ps clk_d = clk;
assign #700ps w_clk_d = clk_d;

Note:- If you want to get a delayed version use NBA, They can sample & schedule assignment for every change of RHS signal

File I/O error

To move transport delay assignment to schedulers active region, Use below code

logic w_clk_d;
always @(clk) fork
  begin
      automatic logic sample_clk; // visible only locally with in the fork thread
      sample_clk = clk; // local copy of clk
      #1400ps;
     //#1400ps;
      w_clk_d = sample_clk;
  end
join_none // non-blocking, allows detection of next @(clk)
